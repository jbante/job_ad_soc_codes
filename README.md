# job_ad_soc_codes
 
This is a personal project inspired by my previous job in workforce development. The objective is to label job ads with standard occupational classification (SOC) codesâ€”ideally using an embedding of job ads that could be useful for other tasks, such as identifying emerging occupations not well-described by the existing SOC system.

My preliminary efforts achieve **67.4%** accuracy so far, using a combination of latent semantic analysis (LSA), smooth inverse frequency (SIF) averaging of GloVe embeddings, metric learning with neighborhood components analysis (NCA), and error-correcting output codes (ECOC) arranged as a boosting ensemble of logistic regression classifiers. This is a substantial improvement over the **0.1%** that might be achieved by random guessing. This is also better than the **39.3%** accuracy [demonstrated by Nicholas Thiebaut](https://data4thought.com/fewshot_learning_nlp.html) by fitting a *more complicated* model with *more samples* (but less detailed data: titles only vs. descriptions/ads).
